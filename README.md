sendmail.py
===========
Sendmail scripts have been done many times before. However, I needed
something simple and very easy to use, but with several (rather simple)
capabilities. So I wrote this.

It is dirty and not the best organized, but I'd like to keep it somewhere,
and GitHub is my friend :). Perhaps someone will find it useful. 

I'm not sure I did everything right, but it seems to work (which is a good thing, of course).
